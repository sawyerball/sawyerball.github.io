## About Me
### Hello! My name is Sawyer Ball! I am currently a student at Boise State University studying Computer Science. I plan to be intern-ready by Summer of 2022.
### I am currently enrolled in CS-HU 250 which is where I learned how to make this website! I am enjoying what I am learning in Git! 
### Git is so much cooler than I had originally thought it to be!
